GPT-2 Text Generation Application


This project involves creating a basic text generation application utilizing the GPT-2 model to produce text based on user-provided prompts. The focus is specifically on generating content related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The application was developed as part of an assignment aimed at exploring the capabilities of open-source generative AI models.
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed. Additionally, you will need to install a few necessary libraries:

    Clone the repository or download the code files.

    Install the required Python packages by running:
    Output:

The GPT-2 model may generate something like: "Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. By 2030, the aim is to develop the world's poorest nations..."
After the user inputs a prompt, the model generates corresponding text. The temperature parameter adjusts the randomness of the generated content.

Known Issues

    Inaccurate Information: The model may sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or irrelevant to the given prompt.
    Repetitive Text: Especially in longer text generations, the model might produce repetitive or nonsensical sentences.

Future Improvements

    Fine-Tuning the Model: Training the model specifically on data related to SDGs could enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content.
