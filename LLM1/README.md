**introduction**
The aim of the project is to develop a model for analyzing sentiment in multilingual textual data relating to health and well-being.
This model will identify positive, negative or neutral sentiments, which can be used to measure public opinion, track changes in sentiment over time or identify areas of concern.


**Code Overview:**

1. **Loading Libraries:** Imported essential libraries for sentiment analysis and dataset management.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face and evaluated it on 10 sample reviews from the dataset.


**Running the Code:**

1. Open a new Python environment or Google Colab.
2. Install the necessary libraries using the provided commands.
3. Copy and paste the code from `sentiment_analysis.py` into your environment.
4. Execute the code to view the results and download the `sentiment_results.txt` file.

**Results:** The sentiment classifications for each review are stored in `sentiment_results.txt`.

**Conclusion:** This project illustrates how to leverage a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis using Hugging Face Transformers. It offers a fundamental introduction to dataset handling and NLP model usage.
